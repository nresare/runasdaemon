runasdaemon - A small tool to make command line programs behave as unix daemons

People running unix like systems expect daemon processes behave in certain
ways. A proper daemon is expected to detach from the terminal or script from
which it was started. It is expected to write it's output to syslog and it is
expected to shut down gracefully when receiving the TERM signal.

Software developers, on the other hand, sometimes write software that fails to
meet those expectations. Unfortunately some software environments, such as
java, is missing critical functionality to make daemons behave the unix way.

One example of this, the initial use case of this project, is the minecraft
server. It is distributed as a jar file and when started it doesn't detach
from the controlling terminal. Logging is written to standard out and there
doesn't seem to be any signal handlers installed.

This projects provides a program, runasdaemon, that is used to control another
program. It does a double fork, detaching from the controlling terminal, any
output from the child program is redirected to syslog.

Dependencies
------------

There are no runtime dependencies besides a non-ancient python 2 environment.
It has been developed with python 2.6.6. The tests are written to be run with
nosetest.
